For scaling, the current procedure is:

First do the usual get_scaling.py
Simulate a first pass of build_true_events with lax cuts on veto (sigma_vet=50)
And minus 2 on ionisation.

Only cut =  1.5<EC<15 and Efid<15

=> Then count the number of events in each population with the correct_scaling() function
=> Adapt the scaling by playing on the bounds inf/sup which are used to compute it in the get_scaling() function
